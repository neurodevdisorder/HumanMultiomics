This website contains the analysis and the data from the Total RNA sequencing, small RNA sequencing, and proteomics performed on post-mortem hiipocampus and cortex obtained form Down syndrome and control individuals.

Please feel free to explore and share. Here are some useful links for the final paper:

## Publication
* [Integrative Multi-omics Analysis Reveals Conserved Cell-projection Deficits in Human Down syndrome Brains]

## Abstract

## Data pre-processing

Raw data is available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, NCBI; accession number GSEXXX(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE)).

### Total RNA sequencing

## Gene expression

* Perform differential expression analysis for genes
  * [Hippocampus](differential_expression_analysis.html)
  * [Cortex](cortex_differential_expression_analysis.html)


* Perform KEGG pathway analysis
  * [Hippocampus](KEGG.html)
  * Cortex
  
* Cell-type enrichment (EWCE)

## Transcript expression

* Perform differential expression analysis for transcripts
  * [Hippocampus](hippo_DET.html)

## Other investigations
  * [GABA and AMPA receptors](GABA_AMPA.html)
  * We investigated the presence of [Genome wide dysregulation domains](GEDD.html) and here we show chromosome 1 as an example.
